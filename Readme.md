# Flair #

Flair started up as a tool used for evaluating css precompilers. CoffeeScript came along for the ride.

Currently Flair supports converting less, sass and coffee script with stylus comming as the next feature.

## Requirements ##
* .net framework 4.5

## Known problems ##
* When the tool reports a weird error - just start typing

## Future plans ##
* Equip flair with a reasonable code editor
